# _June 13-30_

Beginning with a meeting on 13 June and continuing over the following two weeks, my supervisor and I progressively narrowed the scope of the project and defined specific learning outcomes, which are set down in the [Learning Outcomes Documentation](/chapter1.md).

Gaining experience and proficiency in processing born-digital archival material is the primary focus of my DFW, and will be the basis for additional work such as creating documentation and assessing software. Much of my time during the first two full weeks \(19-30 June\) was spent learning the basic operations necessary to generate disc images from physical carriers and generate a simple characterization of the information they contain. Towards the end of this period I encountered a significant technical issue with the imaging process, and began work to ameliorate the problem.

## Stabilizing and Characterizing Data Received on Physical Carriers

### Overview

Work started with an accession from the UW Public Health Program. Along with paper documents, this collection includes born-digital material on more than 100 physical carriers, mostly 3.5-inch floppy discs.

With the more long-term goal of extracting and stabilizing the data contained in all of the physical carriers \(as outlined in [A1-A3 of the Learning Outcomes Documentation](LearningOutcomesDocumentation.md#a1)), I began by reviewing 42 disc images and accompanying metadata that had been created previously. This process was useful in two ways. First, as I attempted to reproduce and confirm analysis results, it allowed me to become familiar with some of the software tools I would be using throughout my DFW. Second, inventorying pre-existing disc images and metadata allowed me to see what kinds of information I would be compiling and tracking, and design a spreadsheet to contain it. The gradual inventory process allowed me to add to and adjust the spreadsheet design over time, and by the end of the review I had a fairly streamlined format to use going forward.

### Software tools

#### [BitCurator Environment](https://wiki.bitcurator.net/index.php?title=BitCurator_Environment)

The BitCurator environment is a Linux-based, free and open-source operating system packaged with digital forensics software tools. While some of these tools were originally developed for evidentiary use in law enforcement, they also meet many needs of cultural heritage institutions collecting born-digital materials.

The BitCurator tools I started learning immediately—those that play a role in workflows for born-digital materials at UW Special Collections—are listed below.

##### [Guymager](http://guymager.sourceforge.net/)

Guymager is a forensic disc-imaging tool available only for Linux operating systems, and has been used up until now to create the disc images from physical carriers in this accession. Unlike simply copying the folders and files from a disc or other physical carrier, creating a disc image acquires and preserves additional contextual data such as file systems and deleted or unallocated files.

##### Bulk Extractor

Once a disc image has been created, the Bulk Extractor tool searches the data it contains for personally-identifiable information \(PII\). Knowing whether or not such information—such as telephone or social security numbers, email addresses, etc.—is contained in archival material is important when making decisions about how to provide access to the material.

##### BitCurator Reporting Tool

Using data generated by Bulk Extractor, this tool creates human- and machine-readable reports summarizing PII and other characteristics of the data. These facilitate an overall review and can be used by other archival software tools.

##### BitCurator Disk Image Access

This tool displays the complete file structure of disc images and can be used to copy directory and file names to the information spreadsheet.

#### Other software tools

##### Google Sheets

A spreadsheet is used to list basic information about each physical carrier/disc image in the accession. This includes the accession and physical carrier number for each image, a complete directory listing when available \(see [1-6 July](/july-1-6.md)\), and details regarding the kinds of PII found.

##### [Bagger Tool](https://github.com/LibraryOfCongress/bagit-java)

Once disc images and accompanying metadata have been created, the Bagger Tool is used to move these files en masse to network storage.

## Challenges

### Extremely slow imaging of discs

Following the review process, I was ready to begin imaging new physical carriers from the accession. However, the first 3.5-inch floppy I attempted to image presented serious problems. Having started Guymager and left it to run overnight, I returned the next day to find that after more than 18 hours of run time, only an estimated 40% of the process had been completed.

The last one-and-a-half days of this period were occupied primarily with troubleshooting hardware and software, and searching for alternate disc-imaging software that might provide better results.
