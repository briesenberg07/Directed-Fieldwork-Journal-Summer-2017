# Some notes on CKAN and Dataverse
### CKAN
#### About:
Metadata: Title, unique identifier, groups, description, data preview, revision history, license, tags, multiple formats (if provided), API key  
Handling of CSV/Excel files (since this seems like what a lot of our data will be): ???
#### Pros: 
Used for civic data similar to ours ("official data portals by national and local governments")  
Accepts common file types of our data  
Supports visualizations and geospatial data
#### Cons:
Looks too much like Facebook :) 
### Dataverse
#### About:
Metadata: "description/citation, domain-specific or custom fields, file metadata"  
Handling of CSV/Excel files (since this seems like what a lot of our data will be-BR): ???
#### Pros: 
Can host dataverses inside main dataverse repository (subsets) (I don't know what this means)  
Geospatial mapping  
Good citation support (but not that relevant to us)
#### Cons: 
Mostly geared toward research data-JH
## Path to implementation: ???
