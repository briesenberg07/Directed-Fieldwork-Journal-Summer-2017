## Key

## 1 \| Learning outcome

## 2 \| Project or task description

## 3 \| Evidence/criteria for evaluation

### A1:

#### Gain proficiency in the ingest and appraisal of born-digital archival material, and in preparing submission information packages for transfer to preservation and access environments

#### A2:

Required tasks include the use of software included in the BitCurator environment and other software tools to create digital objects and perform a series of actions on them. This includes creating disc images from floppy discs, CDs, DVDs, and flash drives; inventorying the directories and files contained in these images; generating summary reports of personally-identifiable information \(PII\); generating and consolidating additional metadata describing disc images; and packaging the image files along with associated metadata.

### A3:

This outcome will be evaluated based on the successful preparation of submission information packages which meet specifications defined by the DFW supervisor \(Digital Collections Curator\), which are based on best practices, site-specific hardware and software configurations, and other factors. It will also be evaluated based on a work record to be compiled by the participant in narrative, outline, and/or other forms, detailing tasks performed, problems solved, tools used, materials processed, etc.

### B1:

#### Gain proficiency in creating and/or assembling how-to and support documentation for the use of software tools

#### B2:

Work towards this learning outcome will have two components. The first will be the creation of a draft student manual for using the software tools required to complete tasks described in [A1](#a1)-[A3](#a3). The second will be collaborative work as part of a group tasked with the creation of how-to documentation for digital archiving and preservation software, as well as with gathering information about digital preservation software tools and platforms and the feasibility of their use within UW Special Collections.

Specific tasks may include surveying existing software and tool documentation, adapting documentation to make it applicable to conditions at UW Special Collections, writing and editing new documentation, and presenting findings for feedback and approval.

### B3:

Evaluation of this outcome will be based on a completed draft student manual. For the group work component, it will be based on a record of participation, including contributions to any documentation created by the group.

### C1:

#### Gain experience in researching software tools and platforms and assessing their feasibility for use in site-specific conditions

#### C2:

Work towards this learning outcome will have two components. The first will be using two separate software applications for providing access to email archives, assessing the functionality of each, and presenting these findings to staff at UW Special Collections. The second will be collaborative work as part of the group described in [B2](#b2). This groupâ€™s tasks include the compilation of functional requirements to be met by digital preservation software adopted for use in Special Collections, and assessment of various digital preservation software platforms.

Specific work required for this learning outcome may include researching and installing software applications, using installed software to provide access to an email archive and/or other digital archival material, researching software, describing archival workflows in detail and identifying functional requirements for associated software, and presenting findings for feedback and approval.

### C3:

Evaluation of this outcome will be based on a presentation of findings from the use and testing of email-archive access software. In the case of group work, it will be based on a record of contributions, including software researched, information/documentation gathered, and other contributions to the group.
