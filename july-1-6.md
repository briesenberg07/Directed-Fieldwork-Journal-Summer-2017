## Software Tools

### FTK Imager

After encountering extremely slow imaging times using Guymager, I searched for alternate disc-imaging software. A [Library of Congress page on the Expert Witness Disk Image Format \(EWF\)](https://www.loc.gov/preservation/digital/formats/fdd/fdd000406.shtml#sustainability)--the disc-image format generated by Guymager--contained a link to [FTK Imager](http://accessdata.com/product-download/ftk-imager-version-3.2.0) \(version 3.2.0\) software, which I downloaded and installed. While the BitCurator environment is a Linux-based operating system running in a virtual machine \(VM\), FTK Imager is windows software, and so was installed accordingly in the Windows environment. This will necessitate some switching back and forth between Windows and the VM when imaging discs and analysing them using the BitCurator tools.

Initial imaging of test discs with FTK Imager 3.2.0 concluded successfully, and the Expert-Witness format disc images that were created proved to be compatible with BitCurator analysis tools \(see the [previous post](june-13-30.md) for a description of these tools\).

Following this, a 3.5-inch floppy disc from the accession was tested. This was completed in approximately 30 minutes, as compared to an hours-long incomplete imaging process for the same disc using Guymager.

This success was tempered by the fact that the created image was empty—no directory or file structure was detected by the imaging software[^1]. To determine whether this was the fault of the software or a problem with the disc itself, we looked back over the discs previously imaged using Guymager. Finding empty image files among the previously processed discs, we reasoned that the problem could originate with the discs themselves.

To further test this line of reasoning and confirm that FTK Imager would not fail to process discs that Guymager could handle, we tested another disc from the accession. We selected one in which a directory structure had been detected and reproduced by Guymager, and identical successful results were obtained with the new software.

Finally, a number of discs with empty images were tested in an internal hard drive mechanism on an older-model PC to see whether or not any files could be detected. They could not, and attempting to access them generated an error message stating that they were improperly formatted. This led us to conjecture that perhaps these were Apple-compatible discs, or were simply unreadable for some other reason. These results were noted in the information spreadsheet for discs in the accession, with the intent to attempt access on an Apple machine when possible. These tests—while falling far short of scientific method—allowed us to move forward with processing using FTK Imager.

An additional advantage of this new software is that along with an information text file, a .csv file detailing the directory structure is also generated in the imaging process \(in the case of empty images, this file is blank except for column headings[^2]\). In the previous workflow with Guymager, using BitCurator’s Disk Image Access tool to transfer directory information to the spreadsheet was a laborious process in which each directory name and filename had to be individually copied and pasted, so the ability to transfer this information en masse shortens processing time significantly.

## Other Work

### Technical support documentation and software assessment

As indicated in the [Learning Outcomes Documentation](/chapter1.md), I will be creating how-to documents for the tasks I am performing to ingest and appraise born-digital archival material. This will allow me to gain experience creating technical documentation, and provide my supervisor with a resource for training future student assistants and others.

This work also lines up with current efforts to streamline and formalize an overall processing workflow for born-digital material at UW Special Collections. As part of this process, four working groups have been created to focus on communication, policies and procedures, workspaces and storage, and technical support, including members from Special Collections and other library units.

As group meetings and report-outs overlap with my DFW period, I will be able to participate in the technical support working group, which is tasked with creating technical workflow documentation. The how-to materials I will be working on can meet some of these needs, and along with contributing documentation, I will have the opportunity to participate in the group’s assessment of software platforms for digital processing, access, and preservation. My assessment of email-archive access software[^3] may also be presented to this group.

### Supporting work on policies

While I won’t be participating formally in the policies and procedures working group, many aspects of the processing workflow I am performing will be addressed by the documentation they create. I am working to accurately document my workflow and decision-making and share this information with the group.

[^1]: Both Guymager and FTK Imager generate a text file containing information about the imaging process. In the case of this and other empty disc images, the following message was generated within this info file: "ATTENTION: / The following sector\(s\) on the source drive could not be read: / 0 through 3071 / The contents of these sectors were replaced with zeros in the image."
