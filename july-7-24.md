## Stabilizing and Characterizing Data Received on Physical Carriers

I continued to process floppy discs, as well as two Zip discs, from the UW School of Public Health collection during this period. Once reaching disc number 80, however, my supervisor decided to stop processing and make an assessment of whether many of the files on disc were duplicates of paper documents in the accession.

Comparing the [finding aid for the collection](http://archiveswest.orbiscascade.org/ark:/80444/xv30114/op=fstyle.aspx?t=k&q=uw+school+of+public+health#overview) with the information I had recorded about processed discs—writing on the labels, file names, etc.—I attempted to determine how much overlap there might be between paper and digital files. This was difficult given the lack of specificity in finding aid descriptions, and it seems that an accurate assessment might require searching within individual discs and file folders. Given the lack of a definitive answer, meeting with the University Archivist may help determine how high a priority should be placed on continuing to process these physical carriers.

## Creating Workflow Manuals

Building on detailed notes and screenshots of software tools, during this period I began drafting how-to documentation for the tasks I had been performing.

Viewing some initial drafts created using Google Docs, I didn’t like the way that page breaks affected the layout. I hoped to find a way to publish the manuals so that they would be printable, but attractive and clutter-free when viewed online. GitBook seemed to offer good functionality, but the free version would not allow any limitations on access to be enforced. A test section of the documentation posted in Google Sites looked good viewed online and allowed for relatively easy printing. However, the text-editing process was laborious and did not support comments, which I am making heavy use of during writing. Additionally, displaying a document outline in Google Docs facilitates convenient navigation from heading to heading within manuals, and this functionality is not available in Google Sites. In the end, Google Docs was adopted for use with the documentation project.

My current approach is to break the documentation up into sections that each cover a discrete task or software tool. These will be made available as a list, and via links in an overall graphical workflow depicting the entire sequence of tasks. I have completed a number of drafts, but the graphical workflow is still under construction, and many tasks and software tools still need to be documented. Further work will also include integrating this documentation with Asana, a project management software tool used within Special Collections.

## Testing and Assessing Software

During this period I began work towards a third [learning outcome](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1-816B2HB_YlwHBzYBaANKLK3Fk3gnDT4yPfNbt2xzHo), testing and assessing software tools for functionality and feasibility of use. In particular, I began testing software for processing and providing access to email archives, using email data files from a previous accession.

### [ePADD](https://library.stanford.edu/projects/epadd)

I installed and began importing email files into this program following conversion to a usable format using [Stellar Outlook PST to MBOX Converter](https://www.stellarinfo.com/email-tools/pst-to-mbox-converter.php). The ePADD software package includes distinct modules for the appraisal, ingest, processing, discovery, and delivery of email archives, operating within a web browser. Testing of this software will continue for the remainder of my directed fieldwork.
